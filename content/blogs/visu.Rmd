# Project 1:

# Excess rentals in TFL bike

## STEP1: Get and analysis raw data

```{r get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))


# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))
# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))

skim(bike)
```

*(This data include the bike rent daily amount form 2010 to 2020)*

*(data source: london.gov.uk)*

![](/img/blogs/tfl.png)

## STEP2: Visualize the difference between real and expected monthly rent amount

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

# generate expected bike hired value for each month
bike_expected_month<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>= 2016 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(expected_month_year=mean(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(expected_mean=mean(expected_month_year)) 

# generate real bike hired value for each month in each year
bike_real_month<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2017 & year<=2022) %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hired=mean(bikes_hired))

# combine expected and real bike table
combine = left_join(x=bike_expected_month, y=bike_real_month, by = "month", all.x=TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(min_1=pmin(actual_hired,expected_mean)) %>%
   group_by(year)

# graphing ribbon and line

    theme_minimal()+
    theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

```

*(mean are calculated by mean of monthly average from 2016 to 2019)*

## STEP2: Visualize the percentage changes from the expected level of real weekly rentals

```{r tfl_percent_change_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

# combine expected and real bike table  
combine1 = left_join(x=bike_expected_week, y=bike_real_week, by = "week", all.x=TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(change = (actual_hired - expected_mean)/expected_mean, rug_positive=ifelse(change>0, "col1", "col2")) %>%
   group_by(year) %>%                            
   filter(week < 52)                       # to limited the extreme value(the week 52/53 may cover next year)


# graphing ribbon and rug and line and rect
library(scales)     # library for percentage drawing
options(ggplot2.discrete.colour= c("chartreuse4", "red"))     # set the option for default factor color assignment 
h <- ggplot(combine1, aes(x=week), options)
h+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pmin(change,0), ymax=0 ,group=year),fill = "red", alpha = 0.25)+
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax=pmax(change,0),group=year),fill = "chartreuse4", alpha = 0.25)+

## STEP3: Conclusion and techniques summary

> 1.  ***Case Analysis:***
>
>     From the yearly TFL bikes rental amount change, we can see that
>     since 2019 there is a general increasing trend of bike demand.
>     This probably caused by the pandemic and London strike actions.
>     And when the unlock and strike actions new announced, there will
>     be an substantially increase in bike rental amount. In this case,
>     TFL company could consider launch some new membership deal or
>     season ticket pass to absorb more market share.
>
> 2.  ***Programming Techniques:***
>
>     Used massive tidyverse function to clean and edit data; used
>     advanced ggplot function to visualize data, including geom_rug,
>     geom_ribbon, geom_reg, and etc; used various aesthetic function to
>     beauty the graph.
>
> 3.  ***Logic of using Mean:***
>
>     Normally, a mean is used as expected values and in this case,
>     expected rentals. This applies to the cases where the distribution
>     is not extremely unsymmetrical. From the diagrams above, we can
>     see that the distributions are generally symmetrical. If there are
>     cases where the distributions are extremely skewed and have clear
>     outlines, median would be preferred as the value is less
>     distorted.

# Project 2:

# Countries renewable development & CO2 emission per capital (Animation applied)

## STEP1.1: Get and adjust raw data

```{r load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies
labels <- technology %>% 
  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))
skim(technology)
```

| **variable** | **class** | **description**                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| variable     | character | Variable name                  |
| label        | character | Label for variable             |
| iso3c        | character | Country code                   |
| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

*(This data include about 200 technologies in more than 150 countries
since 1800)*

*(data source National Bureau of Economic Research)*

## STEP1.2: Generate renewable energy data

```{r load_energy_data}
#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")
skim(technology)
```

## STEP1.3: Generate CO2 emission per capital data & Countries income level

```{r load_emission_data}
# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))
co2_percap_data<-skim(co2_percap)
co2_percap_data

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level(total 4 levels)
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)
countries_iclevel_data<-skim(countries)
countries_iclevel_data
```

## STEP2: Visualize the top20 highest and lowest % contribution of renewable energy in tatal energy production

```{r min-max_renewables-self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

#Energy Dataset converted to wide format and calculated % of renewable energy (rounded 3 decimal places)
energy_renew <- energy %>% 
  filter(year==2019)  %>% 
  select(c(variable,value,country)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(perc_hydro=round(elec_hydro/elecprod, 3),
         perc_solar=round(elec_solar/elecprod, 3),
         perc_wind=round(elec_wind/elecprod, 3),
         perc_renew_other=round(elec_renew_other/elecprod, 3),
         perc_renew=round(perc_hydro+perc_solar+perc_wind+perc_renew_other,3)) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew))

#Filtered data set for non-negative percentage and chose the bottom 20 countries followed by the graph formatting
energy_min_20 <- energy_renew %>% 
  filter(perc_renew>0) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(perc_renew=sum(perc_renew)) %>% 
  slice_min(perc_renew,n=20) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(perc_renew,country))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

#Filtered data set for non-negative percentage and chose the top 20 countries followed by the graph formatting  
energy_max_20 <- energy_renew %>% 
  filter(perc_renew>0) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(perc_renew=sum(perc_renew)) %>% 
  slice_max(perc_renew,n=20) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(perc_renew,country))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

#Graphs are combined and labelled
energy_max_20 + energy_min_20 +
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
                  subtitle = "2019 Data",
                  caption = "Source: NBER CHAT Database")
```

*(Renewable production are summed up by elec_hydro, elec_solar,
elec_wind, and elec_renew_other)*

## STEP3: Animate the relationship between CO2 per capital emissions and the deployment of renewable

```{r animation-self, out.width="100%"}

#Create a pivot wider format and add new column
energy_perc <- energy %>% 
  select(year, variable,value,country) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(percent_renew = (elec_hydro+elec_solar+elec_wind+elec_renew_other)/elecprod *100) 

# Select only interested columns in energy chart
energy_perc_filtered <- energy_perc %>% 
  select(year, country, percent_renew)
  
# Select only interested columns in co2 chart
co2_percap_filtered <- co2_percap %>% 
  select(country, date, value, iso3c) %>% 
  rename(year = date)

# Join the tables (energy, co2, and income_level)
energy_combined1 <- left_join(energy_perc_filtered, co2_percap_filtered, by = c("country", "year"))
energy_combined2 <- left_join(energy_combined1, countries, by = c("iso3c"))

# Create visualization (packages required)
energy_combined2 %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  filter(year>=1990, !is.na(income_level)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=percent_renew, y=value, color = income_level))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  facet_wrap(~income_level) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% renewables', 
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

*(year account from 1990 to 2020)*

## STEP4: Conclusion and techniques summary

> 1.  ***Case Analysis:***
>
>     From Highest and lowest % renewable production bar chart, we can
>     see that the different countries energy production patterns are
>     significant different in 2019, where the top countries can target
>     over 75% renewable energy production, while the lowest 20
>     countries produced lower than 2% renewable energy.
>
>     From animation graph, we can visually roughly see a negative
>     correlation between emission and usage of renewable energy (except
>     low income countries). This may probably due to the entry barriers
>     of renewable energy production as it is highly costly. Also, this
>     finding would correspond to the common understanding on how
>     renewable energy could be a vital factor in slowing down climate
>     change.
>
> 2.  ***Programming Techniques:***
>
>     Used massive tidyverse function to clean and edit data; used
