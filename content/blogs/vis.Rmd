# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

## Get and clean data

```{r get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

## The challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following graph:

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

# generate expected bike hired value for each month
bike_expected_month<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>= 2016 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(expected_month_year=mean(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(expected_mean=mean(expected_month_year)) 

# generate real bike hired value for each month in each year
bike_real_month<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2017 & year<=2022) %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hired=mean(bikes_hired))

# combine expected and real bike table
combine = left_join(x=bike_expected_month, y=bike_real_month, by = "month", all.x=TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(min_1=pmin(actual_hired,expected_mean)) %>%
   group_by(year)

# graphing ribbon and line
h <- ggplot(combine, aes(x=month))
h+  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=min_1, ymax=actual_hired ,group=year),fill="chartreuse4",alpha=0.25)+
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=min_1, ymax=expected_mean,group=year),fill="red", alpha=0.25)+
    geom_line(aes(y=expected_mean,group=year), color="blue",size=0.8)+
    geom_line(aes(y=actual_hired,group=year),color="black",size=0.2)+
    facet_wrap(~year)+
    labs(
    title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue
and caculated between 2016-2019",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Bike rentals",
    caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store")+
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(10000,45000))+           
    theme_minimal()+
    theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

```

## The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals.

```{r tfl_percent_change_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

# generate expected bike hired value for each week
bike_expected_week<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016 & year<=2019) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  mutate(expected_week_year=mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  summarise(expected_mean=mean(expected_week_year)) 

# generate real bike hired value for each month in each week
bike_real_week<-bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2017 & year <=2022) %>% 
  group_by(year,week) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hired=mean(bikes_hired))

# combine expected and real bike table  
combine1 = left_join(x=bike_expected_week, y=bike_real_week, by = "week", all.x=TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(change = (actual_hired - expected_mean)/expected_mean, rug_positive=ifelse(change>0, "col1", "col2")) %>%
   group_by(year) %>%                            
   filter(week < 52)                       # to limited the extreme value(the week 52/53 may cover next year)


# graphing ribbon and rug and line and rect
library(scales)     # library for percentage drawing
options(ggplot2.discrete.colour= c("chartreuse4", "red"))     # set the option for default factor color assignment 
h <- ggplot(combine1, aes(x=week), options)
h+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pmin(change,0), ymax=0 ,group=year),fill = "red", alpha = 0.25)+
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax=pmax(change,0),group=year),fill = "chartreuse4", alpha = 0.25)+
    geom_line(aes(y=change,group=year), size = 0.7)+
    geom_rect(aes(xmin=14,xmax=26),fill="grey", ymin=-1,ymax=1.5, alpha=0.01)+
    geom_rect(aes(xmin=40,xmax=52),fill="grey", ymin=-1,ymax=1.5, alpha=0.01)+
    geom_rug(aes(color = rug_positive), show.legend = FALSE)+
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.55, 1.05),labels = percent)+         
    facet_wrap(~year)+
    labs(
    title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "% change from weekly averages
calculated between 2016-2019",
    x = "week",
    y = NULL,
    caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store"
  ) +
    theme_minimal()+
    theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

```

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected
rentals? Why?

**Answer:**\

Normally, a mean is used as expected values and in this case, expected
rentals. This applies to the cases where the distribution is not
extremely unsymmetrical. From the diagrams above, we can see that the
distributions are generally symmetrical. If there are cases where the
distributions are extremely skewed and have clear outliers, median would
be preferred as the value is less distorted.\*\*\*

# Challenge 2: Share of renewable energy production in the world

```{r load_technology_data, include=FALSE}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies
labels <- technology %>% 
  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))

#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")

# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)

```

## First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production.

```{r min-max_renewables-self, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

#Energy Dataset converted to wide format and calculated % of renewable energy (rounded 3 decimal places)
energy_renew <- energy %>% 
  filter(year==2019)  %>% 
  select(c(variable,value,country)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(perc_hydro=round(elec_hydro/elecprod, 3),
         perc_solar=round(elec_solar/elecprod, 3),
         perc_wind=round(elec_wind/elecprod, 3),
         perc_renew_other=round(elec_renew_other/elecprod, 3),
         perc_renew=round(perc_hydro+perc_solar+perc_wind+perc_renew_other,3)) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew))

#Filtered data set for non-negative percentage and chose the bottom 20 countries followed by the graph formatting
energy_min_20 <- energy_renew %>% 
  filter(perc_renew>0) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(perc_renew=sum(perc_renew)) %>% 
  slice_min(perc_renew,n=20) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(perc_renew,country))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

#Filtered data set for non-negative percentage and chose the top 20 countries followed by the graph formatting  
energy_max_20 <- energy_renew %>% 
  filter(perc_renew>0) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(perc_renew=sum(perc_renew)) %>% 
  slice_max(perc_renew,n=20) %>% 
  mutate(country=fct_reorder(country,perc_renew)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(perc_renew,country))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

#Graphs are combined and labelled
energy_max_20 + energy_min_20 +
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
                  subtitle = "2019 Data",
                  caption = "Source: NBER CHAT Database")
```

## Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem to go down?

```{r animation-self, out.width="100%"}

#Create a pivot wider format and add new column
energy_perc <- energy %>% 
  select(year, variable,value,country) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(percent_renew = (elec_hydro+elec_solar+elec_wind+elec_renew_other)/elecprod *100) 

# Select only interested columns in energy chart
energy_perc_filtered <- energy_perc %>% 
  select(year, country, percent_renew)
  
# Select only interested columns in co2 chart
co2_percap_filtered <- co2_percap %>% 
  select(country, date, value, iso3c) %>% 
  rename(year = date)

# Join the tables (energy, co2, and income_level)
energy_combined1 <- left_join(energy_perc_filtered, co2_percap_filtered, by = c("country", "year"))
energy_combined2 <- left_join(energy_combined1, countries, by = c("iso3c"))

# Create visualization (packages required)
energy_combined2 %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  filter(year>=1990, !is.na(income_level)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=percent_renew, y=value, color = income_level))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  facet_wrap(~income_level) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% renewables', 
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

#Find out correlation    
kable(correlate(energy_combined2$percent_renew,energy_combined2$value), 
      caption = "Correlation CO2 and renewables")

```

**Answer:**\

Since the correlation value for Co2 emission and usage renawable energy
is negative, we can roughly say that as usage of renewable energy goes
up, we can reduce CO2 emission by up to 33%. This finding would
correspond to the common understanding on how renewable energy could be
a vital factor in slowing down climate change.\
